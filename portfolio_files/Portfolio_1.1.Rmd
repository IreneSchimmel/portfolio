### Portfolio assignment 1.1
#### _C. elegans_ plate experiment

###### A. There is a lot of data in the file, but not always very logically ordered. There also seem to be quite a lot of missing data points.

###### B., C. 
###### For RawData and compConcentration, the expected data type is numeric. For compName, the expected data type is character.
``` {r importing and inspecting file}
CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 <- read_excel(here::here("data/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx")) ##importing file
inspect_columns <- CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 %>% dplyr::select(RawData, compName, compConcentration) ##selecting the columns
skimr::skim(inspect_columns) ##printing overview of the selected columns

```

###### As shown in the overview, RawData and compName have been assigned their expected data types. compConcentration, however, has been assigned a character values. This means that not all data types have been correctly assigned during the importing of the file.

###### D.
``` {r scatterplot graph}
CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = compConcentration, y = RawData, colour = compName, shape = expType)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot from C. elegans experiment",
       subtitle = "The raw data against the compound concentration",
       x = "Compound concentration",
       y = "Raw data") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) 
  
```
###### E. The data type is 'character'. Because of this, the x-axis variables are seen as strings instead of numbers and therefore can not scale them.

###### F.
``` {r assigning proper data type and scatterplot graph}
CE.LIQ.FLOW.062$compConcentration <- gsub(",", ".", CE.LIQ.FLOW.062$compConcentration) ##replace , with . (for data point 259)
CE.LIQ.FLOW.062$compConcentration <- as.numeric(CE.LIQ.FLOW.062$compConcentration) ##assign correct data type

CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = log10(compConcentration), y = RawData, colour = compName, shape = expType), position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1), size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot from C. elegans experiment",
       subtitle = "The raw data against the compound concentration",
       x = "Compound concentration",
       y = "Raw data")
```

###### G. The positive control for this experiment is Ethanol.
###### H. The negative control for this experiment is S-medium.
#
###### I. (1) First, the mean of the different concentrations are calculated, per compound. 
###### (2) Then, these means are divided by the controlNegative mean to calculate the relative effect per compound per concentration. 
###### (3) When these relative values are plotted in a curve, the difference in IC50 (if any) will be shown. 
###### (4) Finally, there may be run some statistical tests to indicate whether there is a statistically significant difference between different curves.

###### J.
``` {r relative values}
controlNegative <- CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 %>% filter(expType == "controlNegative")
cn_mean <- mean(controlNegative$RawData)
cn_mean / cn_mean

means <- CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 %>% group_by(compName, compConcentration) %>% summarise(mean = mean(RawData, na.rm = TRUE))
means$relative <- means$mean / cn_mean

means %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = log10(compConcentration), y = relative, colour = compName), position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1), size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot from C. elegans experiment",
       subtitle = "The raw data against the compound concentration",
       x = "Compound concentration",
       y = "Raw data")
```

###### K. By viewing the data relatively, it visualizes the differences and similarities between data points more accurately than when viewing them as raw data points.

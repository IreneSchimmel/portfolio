###### H. I. https://osf.io/t523v/

###### J. The code mainly makes tables from the data and then runs several statistical analyses.

###### K. The code is very well readeable (4).

###### N. Line 11 asked for "clipboard" as input, but this didn't work. I fixed it by using the readxl library and importing dataset with that. 
###### All lines where a column name uses "." in between words need to be replaced with the column name with spaces.
###### The original code was put in lines: 13, 61, 64, 69, 72, 116, 135, 143, 144, 149
###### The first 150 lines were fixed.

###### O. Despite needing to change some of the code, the reproduction nof a figure was rather easy (4).
